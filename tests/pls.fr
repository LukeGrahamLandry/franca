// symptom: `arr: Array(i64, 3) = init(@slice (7, 8, 9));` choosing the overload for `Array(i64, 5)`
// It works with the arg being i64 but not []i64 or *i64,
// so i think its about suspending in the argument type.
// so the answer that fixes this is to not continue after infer_arguments suspends in resolve_in_overload_set
// but that makes it segfault on run_tests.fr
