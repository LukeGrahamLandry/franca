these are tests that use my tooling with other people's programs. 
so they download a bunch of random stuff by execing curl, git, etc. 
i think it's cool to demonstrate that my programs can be useful to other people, 
but i want to keep a clear separation between (the part of franca that's self contained 
programs where i understand all the code) and (the part where you suddenly have 
a transitive dependency on the whole internet so the tests fail when cloudflare has an outage).

c programs to test import_c:
- lua: interpreter written in c
- wuffs: langauge that compiles to c
- tcc: c compiler written in c (that i can bootstrap with my c compiler)
- qbe's minic/miniyacc: c compiler that generates a couple of the committed .ssa tests

compilers that output qbe ir as text for qbe_frontend.fr:
- hare
