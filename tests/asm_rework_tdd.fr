//! May 1/2: debugging new asm. 

//////
/// Looking for corrupted_types bugs

// The problem here was after switching to stack based ir, I would try to load a pointer into seperate stack slots
// but i assigned the register outside the loop so each part of the typeinfo struct would stomp each other 
// and then the last one would get spread to all slots when tried to put it on the real stack. 
// and it would segfault on something. this was in fact not the problem I was actually looking for. -- May 1

// GetVar in emit_bc was just getting the address without doing a Load.

//   but for zero you're just using add as mov because it doesn't care if the input reg is sp. 
//   so the symptom was do_ptr_type getting a garbage value as its x1 arg, and it was an address because it was coming from operator_star_prefix,
//   which decided to be a flat call for some reason so the junk in the reg was always the args_ptr.
