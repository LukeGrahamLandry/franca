    // TODO: this is correctly an error because you're passing a `fn()V` to a `fn(I)V`
    //       (tho maybe that should be allowed). 
    //       However, the error message is in the wrong place. 
    //       it shows the call to `yield` which means it isn't type checking before emitcapturingcall. 
    //       as contrast, `for0 { (_: Str) |` puts the error here which is right.
