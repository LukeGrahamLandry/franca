// TODO: add to qbe simpl: the trick with multiplies where you can fix division by any constant because it overflows correctly or whatever. 
//       also `if (x % 3 == 0) -> if (x * 0xaaaaaaab <= 0x55555555)`
// TODO: i really need to have an inlining huristic. 
//       manually marking index_unchecked, offset, offset_bytes as #inline makes qbe 4x faster at this program.
//       (that's almost as good as llvm release mode).
// TODO: be able to write tests like "do_division must not contain the sdiv instruction"
