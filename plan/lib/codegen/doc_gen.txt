//
// TO-DO:
// something that parses the format used in examples and generates html 
// - syntax highlighting for code blocks 
// - comments as page text 
// - table of contents 
// - make sure a program generating docs for itself doesn't parse everything twice 
// - could steal the css from https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook or docs.rs 
//   have two settings, docs.rs has code as the focus, mdbook has code but comments prose is the main content (still i like it being in code file not in md)
//
// Blockers:
// - a compiler that works
// - retain comments in ast nodes
//
// Meaning: mostly steal from rust
// - `/// text` means documentation on the following declaration. 
// - `//! text` means documentation on the parent declaration. 
// - `// text` is a normal comment ignored by doc_gen
// - surrounded by a box of slashes means a section. which is nice because i like big files. 
//   maybe i should just use markdown header syntax. 
//   FAQ: why not use packages with smaller files. clearly you admit this file isn't really a single unit of code. 
//        - I like being able to press cmd-f and search a "package" without seeing results from the whole project (like cmd-shift-f would do). 
//        - I don't like clicking around between files alot. 
//        - i do admit it makes it harder to have them open in seperate tabs. 
// - `@link(expression that resolves to a declaration, "optional display text, defaults to name of decl")`
//    means clickable link that goes to the other item's docs
//
