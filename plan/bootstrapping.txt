## Prior Art

There seem to be a few conflicting schools of thought.
- A) Self hosting is hard and cringe. 
- B) Just use the last binary. 
- C) Write an <implementation> in someone else's language. 
- D) You can use an old binary but it has to be on a vm. 
- E) It only counts if you go from source all the way. 

### A) Self hosting is hard and cringe. 

- https://www.swift.org/documentation/swift-compiler/
- https://odin-lang.org/docs/faq/#is-the-odin-compiler-self-hosted

### B) Just use the last binary. 

- Rust, Java, Ocaml

### C) Write an <implementation> in someone else's language.

### D) You can use an old binary but it has to be on a vm. 

- https://ziglang.org/news/goodbye-cpp/

### E) It only counts if you go from source all the way. 

- https://bootstrappable.org/
- https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rdriley/487/papers/Thompson_1984_ReflectionsonTrustingTrust.pdf

Kinda an extension of (C) but you make sure you choose a language that can bootstrap from source somehow.
