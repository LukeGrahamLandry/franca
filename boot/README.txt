since the compiler is self hosted, you need an old version to build a new one. 
this is updated from the github actions build of the previous commit as needed. 

note also that this is not the lastest version of the compiler.
it's just an arbitrary old one that is new enough to understand the code for the lastest compiler. 
it doesn't need to be updated to support a new language feature until the compiler itself uses that language feature.
