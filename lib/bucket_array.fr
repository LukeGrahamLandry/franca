//! A growable collection similar to a List, however, 
//! it stores entries in seperate chunks, instead of doing a copying resize when it runs out of memory. 
//! So you lose the ability to elements as one contiguous slice but in return get stable addresses, 
//! so you can safely hold internal pointers (until you call drop or clear). 

/// This implementation does not guarentee that all buckets are full, so you can't index the collection. 
/// But when you push_all a whole slice at once, it is guarenteeed to be stored contiguously 
/// (allocating a new bucket if out of space, which may be bigger than bucket_size), so you get back a slice to it.
/// TODO: will probably want a version that makes the opposite trade off eventually.
