//! I have mixed feelings about this. It's a heavier runtime than I really want... 
//! but it makes debugging a hell of a lot less painful. 
//! 
//! For reference,
//! - libbacktrace 16k lines of c. 
//! - addr2line is 3k lines of rust... plus a 700 line lock file (including gimli for dwarf parsing, 42k lines).
//! Both rely on your executable having metadata in standard format (itanium c++ exception tables or dwarf debug info),
//! that is more complicated to generate than I'm willing to deal with (I could have llvm do it but that's still painful and I want to support many backends). 
//! I'm sure they solve a hard problem and solve it well/fast/whatever, but its clearly a more complicated problem than the one I have.
