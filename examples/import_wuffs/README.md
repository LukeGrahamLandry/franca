This is a compiler for wuffs-the-language (<https://github.com/google/wuffs>). 
> Wuffs is a memory-safe programming language for Wrangling Untrusted File Formats Safely. 
> Wrangling includes parsing, decoding and encoding. 
> Example file formats include images, audio, video, fonts and compressed archives. 
> Wuffs is not a general purpose programming language. It is for writing libraries, not programs.

This is a reimplementation from scratch. It implements the same language as, 
but is not derived from, the original compiler (the one written in go). 
Instead of generating C source code as text, it generates franca-ir that 
can be directly imported by the franca compiler. 

The code I generate will be slower than if you use the original wuffs:
  - because I don't use the SIMD versions
  - because you probably compile their C code with clang/gcc 
    in release mode which do better optimisation than my backend  

There's really no benefit to this implementation. 
Franca programs could already use import_c on the c code generated by wuffs. 
I just enjoy writing compilers and I enjoy being able to compile everything from source. 

# THIS IS INCOMPLETE

- no safety checking
- no codegen
