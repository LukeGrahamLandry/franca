/// Forward Declaration /// 
/////////////////////////// 
// 
// Order of function declaration doesn't matter. 
// The whole program is parsed before overload resolution begins.

// A function with an empty body means someone else must provide that overload.

// - Trait requirements block.

/// Meta Types /// 
//////////////////
//
// A meta type is the compiler's internal representation of a type whose values are types. 
// In Zig this is called a TypeInfo which is perhaps a better name. 
// Meta types are the payloads of the Type enum. 
// Normal programs cannot declare new meta types but they can read the meta type of thier types. 
//
// This feels like a wierd house of cards where next I'll need meta-meta-types,
// but I think it all sorta collapses and works out because meta-types are just an enum. 
// They're not actually special. 
// I've just invented being able to pattern match accross function declarations, just 30 years after Haskell did :)
//
// This syntax isn't really useful outside the compiler. 
// It relies on adding your type as a case of the `Type` enum.
// And it doesn't give you a way to create values of your new type, that needs to be built into the compiler as well. 
// However, its useful for me to have a way to express a type whose values are types. 
//
@assert_compile_error {
    @type Pair = { E: Type };
