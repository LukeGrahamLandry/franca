# like qbe, we allow implicitly truncating a Kl by using it somewhere that expects a Kw. 
# for native targets this is trivial (32 bit instructions zero the high bits anyway
# because they don't want extra data dependencies); we just have to not error on it. 
# but for wasm, we have to insert waste of time casts to make it type check and trust 
# the other guy to compile them to nothing.
