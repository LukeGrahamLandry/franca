An optimising compiler backend based on [Qbe](https://c9x.me/compile/).
Almost everything (ir design, opt passes, isel/abi) is ported directly from Qbe, with some light editing to use a style I find less confusing.

In my brief profiling (with -O2), Qbe spends ~45% of its time parsing the input text and another ~15% outputting the assembly text.
Then clang takes as long to assemble that text as the whole Qbe part (or somehow 10x as long on aarch64).
However I want to use this as a JIT for comptime execution, which will only be practical if I remove those serialization steps.
You can still print out the ir as human readable text between passes and modify it for testing.

If you use llvm you don't get full c-abi compatibility for free.
For example, here's where rustc does it in the frontend https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/compiler/rustc_target/src/abi/call/mod.rs

## Changes from Qbe

- Generate machine code directly without depending on an external assembler.
  Your program will contain only the finest organic bit patterns lovingly transcribed from the Arm Architecture Reference Manual.
- Jit compile your program and run it in memory without needing to emit/link an executable.
  You can freely call between jit and aot code (even extern-c code from other compilers) because they follow the same standard abi.
- Moved a bunch of static variables to a data structure we pass around explicitly.
  Eventually you will be able to compile multiple modules on parallel threads (not yet tho, there's still more unported).
- Removed several codegen optimisations until we have a solid foundation (but I want to bring them back eventually).
  - arm: loading float constants from memory
  - arm: logimm single instruction load int more constants
  - arm: use of bl for calling a constant (instead of blr)
  - arm: constant immediate without an extra register when accessing thread locals
- Removed the RISC-V target for now because I haven't done thier instruction encoding yet.
