An optimising compiler backend based on [Qbe](https://c9x.me/compile/).
Generated code is much better than llvm -O0 and much worse than llvm -O2 (not the most specific range i realize).
It also compiles much faster than even llvm -O0.
Almost everything (ir design, opt passes, isel/abi) is ported directly from Qbe, with some light editing to use a style I find less confusing.
The main changes are working towards being more usable as a standalone library
by removing dependencies on external assemblers/linkers and removing serialization steps to/from text files.
You can still print out the ir as human readable text between passes and modify it for testing.

## Example Frontends

- Franca (../compiler/emit_ir.fr)
- Qbe IR (./meta/parse.fr)
- C11    (../examples/import_c/compile.fr)
  - WIP
- Wasm   (../examples/import_wasm/convert.fr)
  - WIP

## Changes from Qbe

### Targets

- Generate machine code directly without depending on an external assembler (arm clang is so slow!).
  Your program will contain only the finest organic bit patterns lovingly transcribed from the Arm Architecture Reference Manual
  (or painfully scavenged from whatever amd tables i can find).
- Jit compile your program and run it in memory without needing to emit/link an executable.
  You can freely call between jit and aot code (even extern-c code from other compilers) because they follow the same standard abi.
  (This is what Franca uses for compile-time execution).
- Emit Mach-O executables directly without depending on an external linker or make relocatable objects for linking with other languages.
- Ad-hoc signetures for Mach-O binaries so you can target macOS without depending on Apple's `codesign` program.
- Added a Web Assembly target (outputs the binary format directly).
  - WIP: mandelbrot works, not much else
- Emit Elf executables directly
  - WIP: I can't do reloctatable or dynamic libraries yet and exes rely on franca_runtime_init
- Removed the RISC-V target for now because I haven't done thier instruction encoding yet.

### Features

- A library interface for producing and compiling ir in memory instead of outputting text and exec-ing a seperate program to process it.
  (in my brief profiling qbe -O2, it spends 40% of its time parsing the input text. i don't know how that's possible, maybe apple's fgetc is slow).
- Added some instructions
  - bit manipulation: byte swap, rotate left/right, count trailing/leading zeros, count ones
  - floats: sqrt, min, max
  - atomic compare-and-swap 
  - conditional select (ie. `a ? b : c`)
  - syscall
    - it handles calling convention differences but you must use the correct magic numbers for the target os/architecture/version.
    - WIP: you can't access carry flag (for error on macos)
  - walk the call-stack (ie. for printing crash backtraces)
- Insert raw asm bytes in function bodies with arbitrary input/output/clobber register lists.
  > currently very limited: you pick specific registers, do your own assembling, can't reference symbols.  
  > but it lets you access instructions that we don't know about without calling convention spilling overhead.  
  > example use case: a c compiler implementing `__builtin_clzl` as a single instruction.
  > (not well tested because franca doesn't use it yet but it will likely be converted eventually).
- Removed support for thread locals. Franca achieves an equivilent by passing around an implicit env parameter.
- Removed support for custom section names.

#### fixed upstream

- arm abi: respect the platform register (it gets zeroed when you context switch on macos) [issue](https://lists.sr.ht/~mpu/qbe/%3CCAHT_M7NPc_vufQ7hj+JwdB2cVrZKOmKmRk2z8ETLJ4T9=25YRw@mail.gmail.com%3E)
- arm abi: large FHA (ie. struct of 4 doubles) [issue](https://lists.sr.ht/~mpu/qbe/%3CCAHT_M7Pp-6_vSjOd-WkRt4ACJWLrKq=YpgUrnzW0Vy=T-7AFYg@mail.gmail.com%3E)

### Optimisations

- added peephole optimisations for arm isel: ~40% code size reduction vs Qbe on the franca compiler.
  - use of u12 immediate for add, ldr, and store instructions.
  - use immediates for shifts.
  - fuse mul followed by add into 3 arg madd.
- Inline small (single block) functions.
- Elide some redundant memory operations introduced when the abi passes aggregates in registers.
- simplified matching of amd64 addressing modes: instead of 1600 lines of ocaml implementing a dsl
  with 150 lines of glue code to use the results, just write 150 lines of tedious code to solve the problem directly.
- Strength reduction for signed div/rem by power of two (using a conditional move to get the right rounding for negative numbers). 
- Removed several codegen optimisations until we have a solid foundation (but I want to bring them back eventually).
  - all: load float constants from memory (instead of using int immediate + fmov)
  - arm: bit field immediate to load int more constants in a single instruction
  - amd: negating floats by xoring from memory
  - amd: use spilled floats directly from memory
