- almost every function can run at compile-time.
- no seperate build config, everything is done with comptime execution.
- comptime functions can manipulate and create types.
- parse interfaces written in other languages and generate bindings. 
- highly configureable semantics to match many different target languages. 
- macros are functions that directly manipulate the ast
