An optimising compiler backend based on [Qbe](https://c9x.me/compile/).
The passes in `opt` are ported directly from Qbe, with some light editing to use a style I find less confusing.

In my brief profiling (with -O2), Qbe spends ~45% of its time parsing the input text and another ~15% outputting the assembly text.
Then clang takes as long to assemble that text as the whole Qbe part (or somehow 10x as long on aarch64).
However I want to use this as a JIT for comptime execution, which will only be practical if I remove those serialization steps.
You can still print out the ir as human readable text between passes and modify it for testing.

> It's just a choice to represent it as the callee knowing which value to use for each argument for each caller.
