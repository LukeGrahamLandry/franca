// TODO:
// something that parses the format used in examples and generates html 
// - syntax highlighting for code blocks 
// - comments as page text 
// - table of contents 
// - make sure a program generating docs for itself doesn't parse everything twice 
// - could steal the css from https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook or docs.rs 
//   have two settings, docs.rs has code as the focus, mdbook has code but comments prose is the main content (still i like it being in code file not in md)
//
// Blockers:
// - a compiler that works
// - comments in ast
//
