This is indented to be a quick overview of the syntax to access language features implemented so far. 
For more detailed examples of how they work, see the `tests` folder.

## Statements

The top level of your program is a sequence of statements that execute at compile time. 

- Function Declaration
    - `fn name(arg: ArgT) Ret = body;` OR `fn name(arg: ArgT) Ret = { body }` (no semicolon needed)
    - ArgT/Ret/body are expressions. 
    - Forward declarations have no body and must be builtins supplied by the interpreter. 
- Eval Expr
    - An expression followed by a semicolon is run for side effects and its result is discarded. 
- Variable Declaration: kind name: T = value;
    - T and value are expressions.
    - kind can be var/let/const
    - type can be infered from value 
    - for var, value is optional, can be uninitialized
- Variable Assignment: place = value;
    - both are expressions. place is treated a bit differently but probably intuative. 
- Backpassing: let name <- call; 
    - pass the whole rest of the block as a closure with 'name' as its argument as the last argument to call. 
    - '{ let a: b <- c(d); e }' === '{ c(d, fn(a: b) = { e }) }'

### @At Macros (Stmt)

A statement can have any number of annotations preceding it. 

- @comptime F:
    - Allow using the argument values in the return type expression. 
- @inline F:
- @noinline F:
- @c_call F:
- @annotation F: This function defines an @At Macro. Implies @ct.
- @rs F AND @bs F: used during bootstrapping.
- const N = @enum(T) (A = B, C = D):
- @rs F: Translate that function into rust.
         Used for the instruction encoding stuff that the compiler needs to call.
- @bs F: Save the asm of that function and use that instead of trying to compile it.
         Used for the math you need to run the output of @bits for assembling other inline asm at comptime.
- @ct F: This function needs the compiler context. Generally implies it can only be called at comptime.

## Expressions

An expression is one inner then any number of suffixes. 

### Inner

- Variable Access: raw identifier
- Tuple: (a, b, c)
- Struct Literal: (name: Value, a: b)
- Closure: fn(args: A) T = body
- Block: { S1; S2; e }
- Number: 1290 OR 0b10101010 OR 0x190ABF
- String: "Hello World"
- @At Macro: (@name(A) B)

### Suffix

- Function Call: e(args)
    - a tuple used as arguments
- Field Access: e.name
    - returns a pointer
    - struct: compute a field offset
    - enum: access a payload (illegal to access an inactive varient)
- Dot Call: e.name(a) 
    - syntax sugar for 'name(e, a)'
    - not dynamic dispatch. nothing special about function declaration to make it a method. 
    - higher precidence than field access so you need brackets if you meant to use a callable field. 

#### !Bang Macros

- e!deref
    - as a value expression: read from a pointer
    - as a place expression: refer to the place pointed to
    - e[] === e!deref
- e!addr: get the address of a variable
- e!tag: get the address of an enum value's tag
- e!type: get the type of a value. the expression is not evaluated
- e!struct: treat a struct literal as a type definition
    - a product type with named fields. 
- e!enum: treat a struct literal as an enum definition 
    - a sum type with named varients. 
- e!symbol: add an identifier to the compiler's intern pool
- e!comptime_print: print the ast of the expression and the value it produces
- e!assert_compile_error
- e!asm:
- e!quote:

### @At Macros (Expr)

- '@enum(Raw) (A = B)' === '(T: Type = Unique(Raw), a: T = B)'
    - a unique type that only permits a subset of values of the backing type.
