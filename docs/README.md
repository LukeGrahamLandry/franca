# Franca Documentation

I suspect the best way to learn at this point is to just look at the examples, 
but some things are subtle enough that it would feel rude if I didn't write them down, 
and some things are dumb enough that I should defend myself. 

- introduction: just enough syntax to be dangerous 
- aggregates: more complicated types like structs, enums, slices, etc. 
- generics: how to write functions that work for arbitrary types
- compilation: high level overview of the franca compilation model
- annotations: how to attach metadata to franca programs and query it from comptime code
- comptime: example usecases for full compile time execution
- concessions: rambling defense of some language design decisions
- lib_summary: list of useful code provided with the franca distribution 
- builtins: list of magic functions provided by the franca compiler 
- graphics: notes about the franca `graphics` library (gpu rendering)
- backend: notes about the franca `backend` library (codegen NOT website)
