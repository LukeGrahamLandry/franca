/*
Trying to list all the code that contributes to compiling a Franca program and wasn't written by me.  

## Buildtime
> Needed for building the compiler but don't show up in the final binary. 

- rust compiler, cargo, et al. 
    - The bootstrap (and currently only) compiler is written in rust and so relies on thier tooling. 

## Comptime

- rust standard library
- codemap and codemap-diagnostic
    - Representing spans in the source code and rendering those nice error messages that reference them
- (optional, CLI) https://llvm.org/docs/CommandGuide/llvm-mc.html  `feature="dis_debug"`
    - disassemble jitted machine code 
- (optional) LLVM `feature="llvm"`
    - A (wip) llvm backend is provided for when you want optimised code. 
- (optional) Cranelift `feature="cranelift"`
    - the default jit backend on x86

## Language server  `feature="lsp"`

- lsp-types and lsp-server (from rust-analyzer)
- serde
