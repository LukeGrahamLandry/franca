Trying to list all the code that contributes to compiling a Franca program and wasn't written by me.  

## Buildtime
> Needed for building the compiler but don't show up in the final binary. 

- rust compiler, cargo, et al. 
    - The bootstrap (and currently only) compiler is written in rust and so relies on thier tooling. 
- syn, quote, proc-macro2
    - I have a derive macro that for moving typed values between rust and the interpreter. 

## Comptime

- rust standard library
- codemap and codemap-diagnostic
    - Representing spans in the source code and rendering those nice error messages that reference them
- https://crates.io/crates/libffi
